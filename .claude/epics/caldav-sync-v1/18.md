# Task: Documentation — README, usage guide, CHANGELOG

## Description
Write production documentation for the plugin. The current README.md is the sample Obsidian plugin boilerplate. Replace it with actual project documentation including setup instructions, usage guide, and a changelog covering all PRs to date.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] README.md rewritten with: project description, features, requirements, installation, configuration, usage, development setup
- [ ] Usage guide created at `docs/usage.md` covering: first-time setup, sync queries, task IDs, metadata mapping, troubleshooting
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md created covering PRs #1-#5 and the v1 release
- [ ] manifest.json metadata is correct (name, description, author, version)
- [ ] No references to beads, old STATUS.md, or debug commands

## Technical Details
- **Modified files:** `README.md`, `manifest.json`
- **New files:** `docs/usage.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`
- **Reference material:**
  - `docs/adr/` — architectural decisions to reference
  - `docs/obsidian-tasks-api-reference.md` — API details
  - `.claude/prds/caldav-sync-v1.md` — feature descriptions and user stories
  - GitHub PRs #1-#5 — for changelog entries

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 003 (sync engine) — need to document final sync behavior
- [ ] Task 004 (UI cleanup) — need to document final commands and settings

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 4-6
- Parallel: true (can start after 003/004, parallelizable with 005)
